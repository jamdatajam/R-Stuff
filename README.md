# R-Stuff
	Some scripts I've written in R Studio
	BasketballDataAnalysis.R (2018) is code for some quick data analysis in R. The data is stored in matrix form in BasketballData.R (run this one first to get the data into R Studio).
	DemographicDataAnalysis.R (2018) is a quick demographics data run through to get used to qplot. Script pulls in data from DemographicData.csv.
	RottenTomatoesDataAnalysis.R (2018) is an attempt I did with ggplots using data from Rotten Tomatoes. Script pulls in data from Movie-Ratings.csv.
